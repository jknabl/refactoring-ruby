# Chapter 4: Building Tests

* Red/green/refactor. Write a failing test, make it pass, then refactor.
  * Allows completing large refactorings with confidence that you haven't broken anything.
  * Productivity ($$$) gain.

* Quality Assurance (QA) tests are different from dev tests. They disregard programmer productivity and are only concerned w/ QA to the customer. Functional testing a whole system. 

* Testing should be _risk-driven_. There is little sense to testing a simple getter/setter. Test where things can go wrong.
